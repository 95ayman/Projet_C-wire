# C-Wire-project

Hello, here is my c-wire project

After downloading the files, go to the terminal.

First give the execution permission of c-wire.sh with chmod.
For example : chmod +x c-wire.sh

Then start the programm.
For example : ./c-wire.sh file.csv station consumer

If you need help type : ./c-wire.sh h

Since I did not put the csv files in the repositorym you should add it.

The output will be on the data.csv folder


The features that I did not do :
- Gnuplot part with the graphics
- time calculator between the different action
